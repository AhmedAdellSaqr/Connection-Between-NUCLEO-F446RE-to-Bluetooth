# Connection-Between-NUCLEO-F446RE-to-Bluetooth
In my project, the NUCLEO F446RE board is connected to a Bluetooth module (such as HC-05) via UART protocol. This wireless connection enables communication between the smart car and the mobile app, allowing the user to send and receive control commands, enhancing smooth interaction and remote operation.
